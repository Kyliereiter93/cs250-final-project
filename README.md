## ðŸ“Œ Sprint Review and Retrospective Submission

This repository includes my Sprint Review and Retrospective for the final project in CS 250. It demonstrates what Iâ€™ve learned about Scrum and Agile throughout this course, including the work I did in different team roles.

### ðŸ’­ Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?**  
User stories helped me understand what the user actually needs and allowed me to break that into focused tasks that solve real problems. It kept me and the team aligned on priorities.

**How do I approach developing programs?**  
Agile helped me develop in cycles, reflect often, and keep improving. I plan to keep using user stories, sprint reviews, and retrospectives in the future to guide my work.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
Itâ€™s about clear communication, staying accountable, and helping others when needed. Working as part of a Scrum team showed me how collaboration makes the productâ€”and the processâ€”better.
